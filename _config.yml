          In my thesis, I integrated a Reinforcement Learning framework into the FPGA placement flow to dynamically choose the best optimization strategy during the detailed placement. I developed several reinforcement learning models, such as Tabular Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, and Advantage Actor-Critic models using TensorFlow, to capture different characteristics of each circuit placement and use them in the decision-making process. The proposed framework was able to reduce the runtime by 50% while solution quality is preserved.

          Tapsi is a mobility service provider in Iran. I was a part of the data team in the commercial department. Our role was to Identify trends and capture insights of customersâ€™ trips in each season using unsupervised and clustering algorithms to offer competitive fares (increased profitability by 3%). Another duty of mine was retrieving data for the weekly trips and publishing interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights using SQL and Power BI.

          I implemented an RL Agent which regulates cache voltage to maintain a suitable trade-off between power and quality in approximate applications.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started my undergrad studies in electrical engineering, which helped me to strenghten my math and engineering foundations. Then, to become more familiar with machine learning, I took Deep Learning and Machine Vision courses. In my BSc research, I investigated application of machine learning algorithms in hardware systems.
