          In my thesis, I integrated a Reinforcement Learning framework into the FPGA placement flow to dynamically choose the best optimization strategy during the detailed placement. I developed several reinforcement learning models, such as Tabular Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, and Advantage Actor-Critic models using TensorFlow, to capture different characteristics of each circuit placement and use them in the decision-making process. The proposed framework was able to reduce the runtime by 50% while solution quality is preserved.

          Tapsi is a mobility service provider in Iran. I was a part of the data team in the commercial department. Our role was to identify trends and capture insights of customers’ trips in each season using unsupervised and clustering algorithms to offer competitive fares (increased profitability by 3%). Another duty of mine was retrieving data for the weekly trips and publishing interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights using SQL and Power BI.

          I was focused on fault management in approximate applications, namely the implementation of an RL agent which regulates cache voltage to maintain a suitable trade-off between power and quality using gem5 and McPAT. This agent can be trained using Q-Learning algorithm to decrease power while it monitors the quality of results and does not let it drop below a specific threshold.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my master’s, I investigated applications of machine learning in FPGA CAD flow. To broaden my understanding of machine learning and data science, I took several courses including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Advance Soft Computing. In my thesis, I applied deep reinforcement learning techniques to the FPGA placement problem.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started my undergrad studies in electrical engineering. Most of the courses I had to undertake were on theoretical mathematics and statistics, which helped me to form a strong foundation in those areas. Later, as I was fascinated by data-driven algorithms and their applications, I took Machine Learning and Machine Vision courses. In my BSc research, I investigated the application of machine learning algorithms in hardware systems.
